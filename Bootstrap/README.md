# Bootstrap

This project focuses on learning and implementing Bootstrap 4.4.1 framework to build responsive web pages. The goal is to master Bootstrap's core features including containers, grid system, components, and utilities without writing custom CSS (except where specified).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Usage of Containers
- Usage of the Grid system
- Usage of Components
- Usage of Utilities

## Requirements

### General
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Use Bootstrap version 4.4.1
- Use the CDN version
- Add this `<link>` in the `<head>` part of your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
