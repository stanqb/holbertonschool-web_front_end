# Form Project

## Description

This project focuses on creating accessible and user-friendly HTML forms with proper styling and validation. You will learn how to structure forms semantically, implement form validation using HTML5 attributes and CSS, create custom form elements, and enhance user experience with visual feedback.

## Learning Objectives

- How to create an HTML5 form with proper semantic structure
- How to choose appropriate input types for different data
- How to constrain form fields with regular expressions and validation attributes
- How to style forms and implement visual feedback for validation states
- How to build accessible forms with labels, fieldsets, and ARIA attributes
- How to create custom search forms with CSS transitions

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- CSS should be externalized in separate files
- No inline styles in HTML
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Project Structure

The project consists of 7 tasks, each building upon the previous one:

0. **Basic comment structure** - Create the foundation with a comment section
1. **More comment basic structure** - Add fieldsets and form groups
2. **Create labels and input container** - Structure the form with labels and containers
3. **Create the inputs** - Add input fields with validation patterns
4. **Add help messages** - Implement contextual help text
5. **Add pure HTML/CSS error handling** - Visual feedback for validation states
6. **Add the search form** - Create an animated search input in the navigation

## Files

- `0X-article.html` - HTML files for each task (00 through 07)
- `0X-styles.css` - CSS files for each task (00 through 07)
- `00-styles.css` - Base stylesheet provided

## Usage

Open any of the HTML files in a web browser to view the rendered form. Each file builds upon the previous task, so:

- `00-article.html` and `00-styles.css` are the starting files
- `01-article.html` and `01-styles.css` add the basic comment section structure
- Progress through each numbered file to see the incremental improvements
