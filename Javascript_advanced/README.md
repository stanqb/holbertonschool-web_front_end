# JavaScript Advanced

This project explores advanced JavaScript concepts including lexical scoping, closures, execution stack order, binding, and callbacks. Through practical exercises, you'll learn how to implement private methods, chain closures, manipulate the DOM, and understand JavaScript's asynchronous behavior.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand lexical scoping in JavaScript
- Master closures and their practical applications
- Chain different closures effectively
- Simulate private methods using closures
- Comprehend JavaScript execution stack order
- Use binding to control function context
- Implement and use callbacks

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All files must end with a new line
- Code must use the `.js` extension
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
